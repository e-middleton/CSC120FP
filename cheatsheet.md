# SPOILER ALERT

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.

doesn't need to be overcome to win, but be aware that there is a moth in map[3][1] one step north from the starting position 
that will eat unknit yarn, some of which (bulky and dk yarn) has no replacement in the game.

In the mine you must answer the riddle of a door in order to walk south into the yarn trove, the answer is "yarn"

try talking to items in locations, I think it's funny
also please look at people and objects, I spent way too much time on descriptions
